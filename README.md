# Project for HoGent and Taijitan 

We had to make a project for the ji-jitsu club Taijitan for our education at HoGent.

From All the projects that were created by students from HoGent, Taijitan chose our project to use on a daily basis.

This project was created in collaboration with: 
* Jarne Deschacht --> https://github.com/JarneDeschacht
* Robbe Dekien --> https://github.com/robbedekien 
* Stef Verlinde --> https://github.com/StefVerlinde


The project consisted out of 2 parts
* .Net
* Java

# .Net

This repository is the .Net project.

The goal was to create a web application where a trainer can start a training and where the ji-jitsu students can consult documentation about what they are learning.

# Java

The java project can be found at: https://github.com/TijsM/Taijitan_Java 

We created a administration tool for the ji-jitsu club in Java. 
This tool can manage
* users
* activities
* sessions
* scoreboard
* ...
